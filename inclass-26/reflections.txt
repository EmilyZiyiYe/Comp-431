What I hoped to learn but didn’t - 
	Nothing, the course was very comprehensive and I learned more than I expected

What did you really enjoy learning about - 
	Learning how to build my own website, it’s nice to feel like I am learning concrete and applicable skills rather than purely theoretical knowledge.

What worked well in the course? and how?
	Schedule was consistent and easy to remember, content was gradual and followed a reasonable progression

What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
	Lecture focuses too much introduction of technology and big ideas, so the demonstrations of coding parts was presented too quickly for any real understanding to be had. 
	Also this course requires too much self-studying to the point where it feels overwhelming, even for very motivated learners.
	Rubric is too strict, leads to one TA unnecessarily taking off points due to harsh interpretations. I understand that the rubric is supposed to reflect the high expectations of the real world, but in the real world, coders do not work by themselves to build an entire website in a few weeks.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class exercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
	See above.

Anything else you like to say?
	Grade on assignment depends too much on who the TA is. One of the TA’s is unnecessarily harsh and the other TA is more lenient. I saw the 70% A distribution on schedule planner and asked previous students how they did so well, and they said it was mostly because the graders were more lenient and did not penalize for all the things we currently get penalized for.
